# Changes Summary - 3D Accessories Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Home Screen (`home_screen.dart`)
✅ **Removed** Test Voice floating action button  
✅ **Updated** Main character model from `rabbit.glb` to `plaipin_pink.glb`  
✅ **Enhanced** Accessory rendering to support 3D models:
- Added `_build3DAccessory()` method for rendering 3D model accessories
- Updated `_buildAccessoryOverlays()` to check for `modelPath` and render 3D models when available
- Falls back to 2D icons if no `modelPath` is specified

### 2. Store Screen (`store_screen.dart`)
✅ **Updated** Yellow Ribbon item to use 3D model:
```dart
modelPath: 'assets/models/yellow_ribbon.glb'
```

## How It Works

### 3D Model Accessories
When an accessory has a `modelPath`:
1. The system loads it as a separate `ModelViewer` widget
2. It's positioned using the `AttachmentPoint` and `AccessoryPosition` data
3. The 3D model auto-rotates independently
4. Size is scaled based on `position.scale`

### Positioning
- **Base position**: Determined by attachment point (head, ears, neck, etc.)
- **Offset**: Applied from `AccessoryPosition` (x, y, z)
- **Scaling**: Controlled by `position.scale` parameter

## Model Files Available

| File | Location | Size | Usage |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| `plaipin_pink.glb` | `assets/models/` | 164 KB | Main character |
| `yellow_ribbon.glb` | `assets/models/` | 6 KB | Yellow Ribbon accessory |
| `rabbit.glb` | `assets/models/` | 160 KB | Legacy (not used) |

## Adding More 3D Accessories

To add a new 3D accessory:

1. **Create/Export** the 3D model as `.glb` format
2. **Place** it in `assets/models/` folder
3. **Update** the store item in `store_screen.dart`:
```dart
_StoreItem(
  id: 'new_item',
  name: 'Cool Hat',
  category: 'Accessories',
  attachmentPoint: AttachmentPoint.head,
  position: const AccessoryPosition(y: 0.4, scale: 1.0),
  modelPath: 'assets/models/cool_hat.glb', // Add this line
)
```

4. **No code changes needed** - the system automatically detects and renders 3D models!

## Testing

1. Run the app
2. Purchase the Yellow Ribbon from Store (0.01 SOL)
3. Go to Inventory and equip it
4. Return to Home screen
5. You should see the 3D yellow ribbon rendered on the character's ears

## Notes

- The Yellow Ribbon is the only 3D accessory currently
- All other accessories (7) still use 2D icon overlays
- Both systems work simultaneously
- The 3D model viewer has `touchAction: none` to prevent interference with the main character controls
