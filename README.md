## ✅ Phase 0 Completion Checklist

- [x] Flutter SDK installed (v3.24.5)
- [x] Flutter project initialized with proper structure
- [x] All required dependencies installed and verified
- [x] Solana CLI configured for Devnet
- [x] Anchor workspace initialized
- [x] Folder structure created (models, services, screens, widgets)
- [x] Flutter app passes analysis with no errors
- [x] Service stubs created for future implementation

## Environment Setup

### Flutter
- **Version**: 3.24.5
- **Location**: `./flutter/bin/flutter`
- **Path**: Add to your shell: `export PATH="$(pwd)/flutter/bin:$PATH"`

### Solana
- **CLI Version**: 1.16.27
- **Network**: Devnet (configured)
- **Config**: `~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml`

### Anchor
- **Version**: 0.29.0
- **Workspace**: `./solana_program/`

## Installed Flutter Dependencies

All dependencies from planning.md Phase 0 requirements:

- ✅ `solana: ^0.30.0` - Blockchain integration
- ✅ `url_launcher: ^6.2.0` - Phantom wallet deep-linking
- ✅ `speech_to_text: ^6.6.0` - Voice input
- ✅ `flutter_tts: ^3.8.0` - Text-to-speech
- ✅ `lottie: ^3.0.0` - Animation
- ✅ `sensors_plus: ^4.0.0` - Device sensors
- ✅ `http: ^1.2.0` - HTTP requests
- ✅ `shared_preferences: ^2.2.0` - Local storage
- ✅ `flutter_blue_plus: ^1.32.0` - BLE for ESP32-S3
- ✅ `permission_handler: ^11.0.0` - Permissions

## Running the Flutter App

```bash
# Navigate to mobile app
cd mobile_app

# Export Flutter to PATH (or add to your ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="/Users/natalieyeo/Documents/repos/plaipin-app/flutter/bin:$PATH"

# Run the app (requires iOS Simulator or Android Emulator)
flutter run

# Or run on a specific device
flutter devices
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

## Building the Solana Program

```bash
# Navigate to Solana program
cd solana_program

# Build the program (uses Anchor's toolchain)
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test

# Deploy to Devnet (when ready)
anchor deploy
```

**Note**: If you encounter Cargo.lock version issues, this is normal. Anchor uses its own Rust toolchain. The build will work when using `anchor build` command (not direct `cargo build`).

## Current App Features (Phase 0)

The Flutter app currently includes:

1. **Navigation**: Bottom navigation bar with 4 tabs
   - Home (Companion screen)
   - Journal (Voice journal placeholder)
   - Mood (Mood tracker placeholder)
   - Hardware (ESP32 BLE connection placeholder)

2. **Service Stubs**: All services have proper interfaces with TODO comments for implementation in future phases:
   - SolanaService - Blockchain interactions
   - VoiceService - Speech-to-text and TTS
   - StorageService - Decentralized storage (Arweave/IPFS)
   - ESP32BLEService - Bluetooth communication with hardware

3. **Models**: Data structures for companion state and hardware devices

## ESP32-S3 Hardware Integration (Phase 5)

The Flutter app includes BLE service stubs for ESP32-S3 communication. The ESP32 device programming is a separate project. The Flutter app side is ready with:

- BLE scanning service
- Device connection management
- Characteristic definitions (Service UUID, State Char, Command Char)
- Bidirectional communication protocol stubs

You'll need to program the ESP32-S3 separately with Arduino/PlatformIO when you reach Phase 5.

## Next Steps (Phase 1)

Ready to start Phase 1: Solana Program Development

1. Implement Companion account structure in `solana_program/programs/solana_program/src/lib.rs`
2. Create instructions: `initialize_companion`, `update_mood`, `record_interaction`
3. Write Anchor tests
4. Deploy to Devnet
5. Get Program ID for Flutter integration

## Development Commands

```bash
# Flutter
flutter doctor          # Check Flutter setup
flutter analyze        # Run static analysis
flutter test          # Run tests
flutter clean         # Clean build artifacts

# Solana
solana config get     # View Solana configuration
solana balance        # Check wallet balance
solana airdrop 2      # Get devnet SOL

# Anchor
anchor build          # Build Solana program
anchor test           # Run tests
anchor deploy         # Deploy to configured network
```

## Troubleshooting

### Flutter not in PATH
```bash
export PATH="/Users/natalieyeo/Documents/repos/plaipin-app/flutter/bin:$PATH"
# Add to ~/.zshrc for persistence
```

### Solana not on Devnet
```bash
solana config set --url devnet
```

### Anchor build errors
- Make sure you're using `anchor build` not `cargo build`
- Anchor manages its own Rust toolchain
- If issues persist, try `anchor clean` first

## Time Tracking

**Phase 0 Target**: 2-3 hours  
**Phase 0 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

All setup tasks from planning.md Phase 0 are complete. Ready to proceed with Phase 1.

**Generated**: Phase 0 Setup & Architecture Complete  
**Next**: Begin Phase 1 - Solana Program Development (4-5 hours)
